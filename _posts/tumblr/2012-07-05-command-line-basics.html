<p>This past weekend I was fortunate to attend <a href="http://railsgirls.com">Rails Girls</a> in SF, and help introduce Rails and the associated tech to around 40 women. After answering a number of common questions many times about the command line, I decided to take the opportunity to make some videos explaining some basic concepts.</p>

<h3>Command Line Basics</h3>

<p>If you&#8217;re just getting started this is going to be a great resource. I cover navigating directory structure with <code>cd</code> (change directory), listing files with <code>ls</code>, printing out the working directory path with <code>pwd</code>, and add some helpful observations and pitfalls you&#8217;ll likely to encounter. Enjoy!</p>

<h3>Opening and Editing Text Files from the Command Line</h3>

<p>This next video covers opening and editing files using the command line and a text editor. This is a critical skill when you start out programming.</p>

<p>After you&#8217;ve been programming for awhile it is easy to forget all of the skills needed even to get started. For many of us we use the command line without thinking, much like we don&#8217;t need to think to breathing. If you know someone that is just beginning, point them this way. Maybe after running through these videos they can get started on my <a href="http://schneems.com/ut-rails">Rails Course</a></p>
