<p>Last week we talked about <a href="https://www.schneems.com/2012/06/14/databases-rails-week-1-introduction.html">why and how we can use databases to store information</a>. This week we&#8217;re going to be focusing on how to use databases to model real world relationships and then use those relationships in Rails.</p>

<p>The first video in this series covers modeling a relationship between a car&#8217;s user and the car in databases. There are many different ways we could represent that relationship so this lecture covers quite a few of them, and talks about why or why not to represent your data using one of the methods.</p>

<p>The second video this week focuses on using ActiveRecord to build and create database backed Ruby objects (models) we&#8217;ll then create relationships between objects using our database.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re new to Ruby you may want to learn how to watch these introductory videos on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zt_PHQbXx4k">using strings in ruby</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxQIvWBnJNk">using hashes in ruby</a>.</p>

<h2>Homework</h2>

<p><strong>First</strong>: <a href="https://guides.railsgirls.com/install">Install Rails &amp; Ruby on your machine</a> and then complete the tutorial on <a href="https://guides.railsgirls.com/app/">building a Rails app</a>. If you get stuck try googling for the answer, look for error messages, check your server logs, and you can always make a post on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com">stack overflow</a>. The point of this exercise isn&#8217;t to have a complete understanding of everything you&#8217;re doing, but to get you some hands on experience working with Rails from a high level. As we go on we&#8217;ll take a look at lower level functionality, and you will begin to feel more comfortable working with the technologies.</p>

<p><strong>Second</strong>: On a piece of paper or in any computer program, write down the association between 5 different real world objects. Use the words <code>has_many</code>, <code>belongs_to</code>, <code>has_many through</code>, and <code>has_and_belongs_to_many</code>. If you want help on the associations you can refer to the <a href="https://guides.rubyonrails.org/association_basics.html">rails association guide</a>. Try explaining the relationships to someone who doesn&#8217;t program, if the relationships don&#8217;t make sense in english, they will make less sense when you map them to code :)</p>
