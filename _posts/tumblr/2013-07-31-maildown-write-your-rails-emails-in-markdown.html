<a href="https://github.com/schneems/maildown">Maildown: Write your Rails emails in Markdown</a><br/><blockquote class="link_og_blockquote">maildown - Write your ActionMailer email templates in Markdown, send in html and plain text</blockquote>

<p>If you&#8217;re anything like me, you can&#8217;t stand writing email content twice, once for html, and once for plain-text. Yet both need to be sent out for supporting email clients that don&#8217;t render html (such as <a href="http://www.mutt.org/">mutt</a>). So what is a savvy markdown loving programmer to do? Write the email once in markdown, and have the <a href="https://github.com/schneems/maildown">maildown</a> gem translate it into text and html for you. Try it out today.</p>
