<p><a href="https://www.schneems.com/2013/10/19/why-do-heroku-builds-run-without-config-by-default.html">Heroku compiles your app without environment variables</a>. This is all well and good, but how do you debug a problem that only shows up when an environment variable is missing? Not just set to an empty string <code>""</code>.</p>

<p>To do this bash has a great feature called <code>--unset</code> to remove an environment variable. For example if you wanted to run <code>rake assets:precompile</code> without the DATABASE_URL from your environment you could run:</p>

<pre><code>$ env --unset=DATABASE_URL rake assets:precompile
</code></pre>

<p>This allows you to simulate missing any environment variables you want!</p>
