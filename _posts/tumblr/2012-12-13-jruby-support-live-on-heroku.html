<p>I&#8217;ve been quite lately, thats because we&#8217;ve been working on something amazing over at Heroku. So check out:</p>

<ul><li><a href="http://blog.heroku.com/archives/2012/12/13/run_jruby_on_heroku_right_now/">Run JRuby on Heroku Right Now</a></li>
<li><a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/moving-an-existing-rails-app-to-run-on-jruby?preview=1">Move and Existing Rails app to use JRuby</a></li>
</ul><p>I had a ton of fun working with JRuby, and Heroku made it super easy. If you&#8217;ve never thought of using JRuby in Production, maybe you can give it a whirrl.</p>
