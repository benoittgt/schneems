<p>Haven&#8217;t you always wanted to make some changes to your server and then absolutely slam it with traffic to see the result? Thats pretty much what I did last week while writing how to <a href="https://schneems.com/2012/04/04/super-charge-your-rails-app-with-rack-cache-and.html">Super Charge your Rails App with Rack Cache</a>, using the BlitzIO tool.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re interested in trying out Blitz watch a demo in the screencast below.</p>

<p>For a walkthrough on how to add Rack::Cache and Memcache to your server read my  <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/rack-cache-memcached-static-assets-rails31">performance article</a> on the Heroku Dev Center.</p>
