<p>Don&#8217;t pump and dump information on your readers: build better community and better view numbers by following the <strong>Prepare</strong>, <strong>Do</strong>, <strong>Test</strong> pattern. Let&#8217;s back up. If you&#8217;re new to my site: I&#8217;ve been teaching <a href="http://schneems.com/ut-rails">Rails courses for a few years</a>, I work with a <a href="https://github.com/schneems?tab=activity">ton of open source</a>, and I generally get a kick out of explaining things to people. I&#8217;ve written for <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/author/rschneeman/">Rubysource</a>, my own blog, and a fair bit of Heroku&#8217;s devcenter documentation. When writing for a technical audience I cringe when I get a comment that says &#8220;I&#8217;m stuck&#8221;, or &#8220;did it work?&#8221; and especially &#8220;what do I do next?&#8221;. To solve these problems and more I follow this framework:</p>

<h2>Prepare</h2>

<p>Introduce the reader to what they will be doing at a high level and what they can expect in the end. It sounds simple but many articles just jump into the &#8220;how&#8221; and completely forget the &#8220;why&#8221;. If you don&#8217;t know what to write: try giving your article to someone new to that subject and writing down all the questions they ask as they go through the exercise. See if you can answer those questions in the article before they even need to ask them. I usually do this for the whole document (see my <a href="https://github.com/centerforstudents/ruby_view_server#what">"what" section in the Ruby View Server Exercise</a>), and I also do this before individual exercise &#8220;todo&#8217;s&#8221; (such as in <a href="https://github.com/centerforstudents/ruby_view_server#3-use-a-layout-to-add-content-to-all-pages">"Using a Layout to add content to all Pages"</a>). Once they know where they&#8217;re going send them on their way.</p>

<h2>Do</h2>

<p>This one is simple: give the user the directions you want them to follow. Focus on context, consistency, and completeness. Should the student by typing those words in a text editor, or the terminal? A little consistency goes a long way. I always make sure to preface all commands that go in the terminal with a <code>$</code>, and I make sure that the user knows this by adding a disclaimer to most <a href="https://github.com/centerforstudents/ruby_view_server#what">tutorials on my site</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>All code that starts with a $ indicates it is running in the terminal. You should not copy the $.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, the best way to see if your directions on doing worked is to give them to a real live person. Ideally you&#8217;ll give it to 20 real live people. If one of them is tripped up by an unstated convention or inconsistent marking or command, then likely others will have the same problem. It&#8217;s okay to not re-hash Comp-Sci 101 in every tutorial, but know your target audience&#8217;s skill level and write accordingly. Put any assumptions or prerequisites early in your writing.</p>

<h2>Test</h2>

<p>The most important and most commonly missed step in technical writing is the test step. Did the command your student just ran work? How are they supposed to know? With the &#8220;prepare&#8221; done correctly, this section is where you give them the tools to verify they &#8220;did&#8221; everything correctly. I recently attended a <a href="http://railsgirls.com">Rails Girls</a> session in Austin and got fed up of students accidentally running <code>mkdir</code> in the wrong section. So instead of just giving them the command they&#8217;re <a href="https://github.com/railsgirls/railsgirls.github.com/commit/9c4cb24e248ee05a361c6cc78d05301be6a62e0b">now asked to verify using <code>ls</code> or <code>dir</code></a> after they run the command. Not only only does this answer the question &#8220;did it work&#8221;, it lets them know that something has gone wrong before they get lost in the next step.</p>

<h2>Outcome</h2>

<p>Writing tutorials and technical docs like this gives your readers the content you&#8217;re writing about, and it has the nice side effect of sharing your workflow. As you write using this pattern, you&#8217;ll realize that you actually develop like this. You have a goal, make a change, and then test to see if the change took effect. When you tell your readers how to check their work, you&#8217;re giving them insight into your workflow. With all the benifits there are a few downsides.</p>

<h2>It takes Longer</h2>

<p>Writing this way takes longer for sure, and in a world where there doesn&#8217;t ever seem to be enough enough time to tweet what you&#8217;re blogging about: time is precious. Sometimes taking longer is a good thing. Ernest Hemingway famously <a href="http://www.openculture.com/2013/02/seven_tips_from_ernest_hemingway_on_how_to_write_fiction.html">wrote using a pencil</a> instead of a typewriter because it slowed his process and forced him to review his work. Maybe it&#8217;s time you spent a little while meditating on your workflow. Sure sometimes you found a quick hack you wanted to share, but taking your time to write about a topic in-depth helps solidify it in your mind and can be reflective.</p>

<h2>It Might Be an Overshare</h2>

<p>Writing in this lock step of &#8220;do&#8221; and &#8220;test&#8221; can be tiresome for senior developers. When I wrote about my experience getting mruby running on my machine for Rubysource there were some comments complaining <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/try-mruby-today/#comment-7032">that I spent too long explaining trivial details</a>. It&#8217;s true you cannot please all the people all the time, so I choose to be inclusive in my writing. Senior developers can easily skim my articles and skip the &#8220;test&#8221; steps they already know. The opposite cannot be said for junior developers. You cannot write a terse article with no explanation and expect them to just &#8220;get it&#8221; 100% of the time. In that same article I got the comment <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/try-mruby-today/#comment-7031">"This post is a true work of love! The average layman thanks you."</a>. I find for every one &#8220;this article is too verbose&#8221; comment, I get a dozen &#8220;thanks, I&#8217;ve struggled with this forever&#8221; comments.</p>

<h2>Technical Writing</h2>

<p>Is a skill that takes time to cultivate. I learn new things every time I put markdown to a blog. If you don&#8217;t write technical stuff: start practicing now for when you need it later. If you are following an open source guide such as Railsgirls consider adding in checksums or tests that will help catch problems without extra assistance. The best way to proof any technical writing is to try it out on someone new to that topic. You can find these people in usergroups and meetups, or if you&#8217;re really lucky, you might find you&#8217;re <a href="http://rubyandrichard.tumblr.com/">married to them</a>. Thanks for following along and next time you write technical material don&#8217;t forget <strong>Prepare</strong>, <strong>Do</strong>, and <strong>Test</strong>.</p>
