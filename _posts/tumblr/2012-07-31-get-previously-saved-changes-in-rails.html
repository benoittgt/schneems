<p>Some times you need to see what fields changed in an object in Rails. I&#8217;ve known for awhile that you could do this before an object saved:</p>

<pre><code>user = User.last
user.name = "schneems"
puts user.name_changed?
# =&gt; true

puts user.changes
# =&gt; {"name"=&gt;["richard", "schneems"]} 
</code></pre>

<p>but as soon as you save the object to the database you lose all that goodness.</p>

<pre><code>user.save
puts user.name_changed?
# =&gt; false 

puts user.changes
# =&gt; {}
</code></pre>

<p>What if we wanted to get the changes before those values were committed? We can use the <code>previous_changes</code> method!</p>

<pre><code>user.save
puts user.name_changed?
# =&gt; false 

puts user.previous_changes
# =&gt; {"name"=&gt;["richard", "schneems"], "updated_at"=&gt;[Tue, 31 Jul 2012 18:53:12 UTC +00:00, Tue, 31 Jul 2012 18:56:49 UTC +00:00]} 
</code></pre>

<p>It&#8217;s that simple. Go forth and make changes with impunity! Your previous results will be available when you need them.</p>

<p>(This only works when the object is still in memory, if you pull a user from the database <code>changes</code> and <code>previous_changes</code> will both be blank).</p>
