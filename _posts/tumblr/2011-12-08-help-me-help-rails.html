<p>Rails needs controller level filter logging and Im submitting a patch to Rails core, but first I want some feedback. Let me know if you like it, hate it,  or don&#8217;t understand it.  All comments welcome, especially alternative implementation &amp; style.</p>

<p>Please let me know what you think, please leave comments on the original gist: <a href="https://gist.github.com/1443757">https://gist.github.com/1443757</a></p>
