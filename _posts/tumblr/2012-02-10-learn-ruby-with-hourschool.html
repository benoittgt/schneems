<p>I&#8217;m teaching a <a href="http://hourschool.com/courses/beginner-ruby-in-austin-tx--2#.TzRCuZh9n0c">beginner ruby class</a>. If you&#8217;ve ever been interested in learning Ruby this is a hands on class with no experience and no software required. Class is this Wednesday the 15th at 7pm in downtown Austin.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;ve never taken a class at <a href="http://hourschool.com/learn">Hourschool</a> before, it&#8217;s a peer-to-peer learning platform that lets anyone teach and take classes. It&#8217;s been a fun way to meet people in the community and pick up some skills too. Even if you&#8217;re not into programming they&#8217;ve got lots to offer, from cooking to color design. Forget going to a boring movie next week, learn how to make bagels with real live people instead&#160;!!</p>

<p>P.S. Hourschool runs on <a href="http://heroku.com">Heroku</a> and I helped build it (in Ruby of Course)!</p>
