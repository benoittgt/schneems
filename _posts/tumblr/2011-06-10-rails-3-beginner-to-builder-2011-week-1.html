<h3>Rails 3 Beginner to Builder 2011</h3>



<p>This is part 1 of my Rails 3: Beginner to Builder series. <a href="https://schneems.com/beginner-to-builder-2011"><a href="https://schneems.com/beginner-to-builder-2011">https://schneems.com/beginner-to-builder-2011</a></a></p>

<p>If you&#8217;re looking to learn Rails 3.0.0 and you&#8217;ve got no experience, then you&#8217;re in the right place. This class taught at the University of Texas is an 8 week long series of one hour classes, taught by yours truly. We&#8217;re going to be doing course work out of the <a href="https://pragprog.com/titles/rails4/agile-web-development-with-rails">Agile Web Development with Rails version 4</a> book, so if you&#8217;d like to follow along at home, you&#8217;ll need to get a copy. Below is the video of the class presentation as well as a copy of the slides.</p>



<p>If you have technical questions and don&#8217;t have time to wait for class I highly encourage you to find chat room on IRC, or to ask a question on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow</a>. I also recommend attending a local Rails user groups such as <a href="https://austinonrails.org">Austin on Rails</a>. Coding is a social sport, so the quicker you can join the community, the better. </p>
