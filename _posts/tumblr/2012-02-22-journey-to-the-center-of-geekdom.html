<p>I thought I was spoiled when I worked for <a href="http://gowalla.com">Gowalla</a>, but <a href="http://heroku.com">Heroku</a> appeals to my true inner Geek. The people, the building, and the oh-so-delicious food have blown my mind. It&#8217;s impossible to turn the corner without bumping into some of the best minds in the community. Where else are you going to find yourself walking to work with <a href="http://twitter.com/hone02">@hone02</a>, a maintainer of Bundler, and playing pingpong after lunch with  <a href="http://twitter.com/bmizerany">@bmizerany</a>, the creator of Sinatra. The knowledge isn&#8217;t just Ruby, there&#8217;s all sorts of Java, Python, and even a little Erlang getting thrown around. You can tell everyone loves working on the Heroku platform by the way they talk about it, and the passion they have for their jobs. I haven&#8217;t run into Matz, the creator of Ruby, since <a href="http://blog.heroku.com/archives/2011/7/12/matz_joins_heroku/">he joined heroku</a>, but I can&#8217;t wait to give him the super-secret Heroku staff handshake (it&#8217;s just a regular handshake).</p>

<p>While I&#8217;ve been working for Heroku for a week now, today was my first day working out of SF. The offices are great: fully stocked fridges, catered lunch, a games room, and Mac power adapters all over the place. It almost makes me wish I wasn&#8217;t working out of Austin (almost).</p>

<p>The building is old fashioned brick, with massive steel girders and origami all over the place. Seeing how intimate and friendly the lunches are it&#8217;s hard to remember just how many people work here. Getting to put faces to names has been great, and it&#8217;s one of the reasons I enjoy going out to events and attending conferences.</p>

<p>Before I flew out to the office, I got to attend my first event as a Heroku employee. On Saturday I helped out with <a href="http://apihackday.com/">APIHackDay</a> Austin. It was a great reminder of why I started programming and took this job in the first place. Seeing a small team or lone developer toiling on some crazy app is really a thing of beauty. I can&#8217;t wait to help out with more events.</p>

<p>We have a ton of great things coming out of Heroku in the future that I can&#8217;t wait to talk about. If you catch me at a user group or conference, say &#8220;hi&#8221; and you might just get a sneak preview. If not, I&#8217;m at least good for a cup of coffee or a cold pint.</p>
