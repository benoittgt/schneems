<a href="http://rdegges.com/heroku-isnt-for-idiots">Heroku Isn't for Idiots: developer time and comparative advantage</a><br/><p>Just got back from EuRuKo in Amsterdam, and getting ready for teaching my first class of the semester at the University of Texas when I stumbled on this gem on HN. The author makes some amazing points and digs deep into an issue that has been clawing at me since I joined Heroku. You should check out the article, even if you don&#8217;t use Heroku. IMHO all products should be built for simplicity and ease of use, and it doesn&#8217;t mean you&#8217;re building for idiots&#8230;just look at Apple products. Wish me luck on my class, I&#8217;ll try to post some materials from it as soon as I get a chance.</p>
