<p>I use custom organization of my .bashrc and .bash_profile i.e. my &#8220;dotfiles&#8221;. Its great to keep all of my aliases clean and organized. I highly recommend Peepcode&#8217;s <a href="https://peepcode.com/products/advanced-command-line">Advanced Command Line</a> for more info on configuring your own set of custom dotfiles.</p>
<p><br/>The one thing I always forget how to do whenever I move to a new computer or hard-drive is to set up the correct files and set up the proper sourcing, so here is my shorthand note to my future self.  </p>
<pre># First copy files to ~/bin/dotfiles
# Open bashrc
mate ~/.bashrc
# Paste this in
```
  source ~/bin/dotfiles/bashrc
```
# Open bash_profile
mate ~/.bash_profile
# Paste this in
```
if [ -f ~/.bashrc ]; then
  source ~/.bashrc 
fi

```
</pre>
