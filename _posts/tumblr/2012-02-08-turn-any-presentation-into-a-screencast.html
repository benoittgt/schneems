<p>Remember that great presentation you gave at that user group? What about that one at the conference, you know the one everyone loved. What if your presentation wasn&#8217;t limited by the number of seats in the room or badges sold at a desk. What if, and this is a bit crazy, you could use some sort of electronic device to record your presentation and share it using a series of connected tubes.</p>

<p>Well now you can!! It is so simple to record your presentations as screencasts you have no excuse not to. Check out this quick video on how:</p>

<p>Quit waiting for con-freaks to show up at your house and beg you to record your material. Give the people what they want. All you&#8217;ll need is.</p>

<ul><li>A Mac</li>
<li>Quicktime</li>
<li>A Presentation</li>
</ul><p>Thats it. Quit reading and go record something.</p>

<p>Do it now!!!</p>
