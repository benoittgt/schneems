<p>If you&#8217;re in the Ruby world, you&#8217;ve likely heard about <a href="https://github.com/mruby/mruby">mruby</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yukihiro_Matsumoto">Matz&#8217;s</a> latest experimental Ruby implementation. What I bet you didn&#8217;t know is that you can run mruby on Heroku right now. As a matter of fact you can run just anything on Heroku, as long as it can compile it into a binary on a Linux box.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re new to mruby, or to compiling binaries take a look at my last article <a href="https://rubysource.com/try-mruby-today/">Try mruby Today</a>. I cover getting mruby up and running on your local machine. If you are already up to speed then follow along as we use <a href="https://github.com/heroku/vulcan">vulcan</a> to package mruby as binary, wrap it up in a custom <a href="https://blog.heroku.com/archives/2012/7/17/buildpacks/">buildpack</a> and then launch an app to use mruby on the Heroku cloud.</p>
