<p>What exactly is OAuth, and how can you use it to access data on sites like Facebook? This introductory video explains the basic flow behind OAuth 2 and how OAuth Clients are implemented.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re using OAuth, you&#8217;ll likely want to use a pre-built client library to help with the process. For Ruby you&#8217;ll likely want to use <a href="https://github.com/intridea/omniauth">Omniauth</a> or <a href="https://github.com/arsduo/koala">Koala</a>, though understanding the process is still important.</p>

<p>This is being posted from Singapore, where I&#8217;m about to give a talk at <a href="http://reddotrubyconf.com/">Red Dot Ruby Conf</a>. Have fun learning about OAuth, i&#8217;ll post slides from my talk as soon as they&#8217;re ready. Wish me luck!</p>
