<p>I use PRY to develop Rails, so should you: <a href="https://github.com/pry/pry/wiki/Setting-up-Rails-to-use-Pry">Set up Pry with Rails</a></p>
<p>I use the .pryrc method, works great. I can reload! and still get the magic of Pry.Â </p>
<p>If you&#8217;re new to pry check out this intro: <a href="https://railscasts.com/episodes/280-pry-with-rails">Pry Railscast</a></p>
