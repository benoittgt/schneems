<p>When Gowalla was acquired by Facebook I wrote that I was talking to companies in Austin and California in <a href="http://schneems.com/2011/12/05/should-i-stay-or-should-i-go.html"> Should I Stay or Should I Go</a>. I&#8217;m happy to announce that I&#8217;ve made a decision on where I&#8217;m going next.</p>

<p>Now you must be wondering&#8230; is it Austin, is it California? Actually it&#8217;s both. I&#8217;m starting work today for <a href="http://heroku.com">Heroku</a> which is in San Francisco, though I&#8217;ll be staying put for now in the live music capital of the world, Austin Texas!</p>

<p>Heroku first launched as I was just learning to deploy my first Rails application. They were the best and easiest back then, and still are today.  I&#8217;m excited to be joing such a great team and working on such an amazing platform.</p>

<p>Keep a look out for future posts on my insider experience with the Heroku!</p>
