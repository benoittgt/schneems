I'm writing this as more of a note to myself than to you. In Ruby `GEM_PATH` environment variable is where rubygems will look for installed gems. Hidden in in the [docs](http://guides.rubygems.org/command-reference/) is:

```
RubyGemsâ€™ default local repository can be overridden with the GEM_PATH and GEM_HOME environment variables. GEM_HOME sets the default repository to install into. GEM_PATH allows multiple local repositories to be searched for gems.
```

On Heroku we can see it used by calling `env`:


```
$ env
# ...
GEM_PATH=/app/vendor/bundle/ruby/2.1.1:vendor/bundle/ruby/1.9.1
```

The second part is for legacy reasons. In the case of codetriage, the first part is where our gems are stored.

This is what the directory structure looks like:

```
$ ls /app/vendor/bundle/ruby/2.1.1
bin  build_info  bundler  doc  extensions  gems  specifications
```

You don't actually point `GEM_PATH` at the `< directory >/gems` path but rather the top level dir where `bin/`, `doc/`, and `gems/` all live. It might be stupid to write down, but it's been confusing to me more than a few times.

Hopes this helps future me.
