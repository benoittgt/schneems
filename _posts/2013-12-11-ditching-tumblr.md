After 2 weeks of support requests with Tumblr over the inability to see basically any code on my old blog. I'm switching to self hosting!

For those of you wondering this is what the formatting problem looked like:

Here's the new, fixed, self hosted version [/2013/09/17/explain-shell-from-your-shell.html](/2013/09/17/explain-shell-from-your-shell.html)
