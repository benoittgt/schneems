During the holidays airports take on a totally different tone. Gone are the seas of suits and small roll-aboards, here are the screaming children and frustrated infrequent travelers. If you are luck enough to not have to fly on a regular basis heres a list of the things that may help keep your: wallet thick, your waistline in check, and most importantly your sanity. Whether you're flying last minute to your in-laws or you're headed home, packages in tow there's bound to be something for you below.

## Save Money

Flying is stressful, in no small part due to the costs of not just the airfare but necessities inside of the terminal. Hungry? Here's a $10 sandwich pre-made three days ago being hawked by a lifeless and uncaring cashier.


### Bring food

Pack a sandwich, some chips, an apple and you've got yourself not just a money saver, but a piece of mind. What happens if your connection is delayed and you have to run to that next flight? No worries, you've got some munchies in hand.

### Bring an (empty!) Reusable Water Bottle

While I don't mind paying $3 for a coffee sometimes, paying the same for a hunk of plastic that will ultimately make it in the landfill is no good use of your hard earned cash. Make sure it can seal tight so your bag doesn't get soaked, the pressure change in flight can cause a poorly sealed bottle to become a river. Also make sure it's empty when you go through security. It will save everyone time.


### Bring Mini Liquors

Are you above 21, not driving when you land, and interested in some holiday cheer? Ditch the over-priced bud-lights in flight and opt for your favorite hard stuff. You can buy small bottles (think one shot) at a liquor store, and as long as they're in a zip lock bag and under the total liquid limit through security. Wait till you get on the plane and the flight attendants will even serve you a free mixer of your choice. Many travel blogs recommend not drinking on flights due to the dehydration. My experience: a drink or two isn't too bad, plus you brought a water bottle with you right? Don't stay thirsty due to over priced booze my friends.


## Save your Waist

Tis the time of turkey and over stuff belts. While it's impossible to un-do eating an entire pecan pie in one sitting, every little bit helps.

### Walk Around, don't Sit at your Gate

You're going to be sitting on a plane for who knows how long? Stretch your legs while you wait for your flight and get some exercise in the process. First find your gate and make sure you know what time it's leaving. Now go for a walk. Head out in one direction for about two and a half minutes, then turn around. Once back at the gate, go the other way. This will give you 10 minutes of active time for each full lap (2.5 out + 2.5 back) and you'll never be more than 5 minutes away from your gate. You'll see if there's changes. If you get bored listen to music or podcasts (I've got that one covered later). 30 minutes of walking can make a world of difference in your attitude and your waistline.

### Cut the Calories

Like a latte? Try skim milk. Usually go for the grande? Try a tall. A big beer drinker? The hard stuff has less calories given the same alcohol content provided you pick low calorie mixers. If you drink soda consider going diet, or switching to water. You got your water bottle right?

### Eat less, more often

I stress eat like none other, so this one is really hard but really important for me. Instead of eating your whole meal in one go, try only eating half then waiting for 30 minutes to an hour. For some reason every time I get off of a plane I feel hungry regarless of if I need to eat or not. I get around this by bringing my meal on the plane and eating half at take off and half at landing.


### Save your Sanity

No guarantees here. Try to stay entertained, in good spirits and stay away from things that will frustrate you. Easier said than done, so here we go:

### Don't stand in Imaginary Lines

If there's one thing I have learned from flying, is that people love standing in lines. Why? I don't know. When they call your boarding group and the line doesn't move, kindly and gently ask the person in front of you if they are in group *whatever*. Nine times out of ten they were just standing behind someone else who was just standing there. If you're at an in-airport resturant make sure you're not standing in the people-who-already-ordered-waiting-for-their-food line. This one sound a little ridiculous, but I see it happen EVERY TIME I go to an airport. Nothing will make you feel stupider, faster than standing in a line for 5 minutes to find out there is no line, or you're in the wrong one. Just ask, you'll thank me later.


### Always pick your own Seat

The auto assigned seats that airlines give out are pretty horrible. Always click the "change seat" button when you check in to at least verify you're okay with your seat. When in doubt check seatguru.com which can give you the low down on your seat spot. If you're tall or have long legs, consider spending the extra cash to get into economy plus (or equivalent). It's more comfortable and you will be closer to the front of the plane, which means you get off sooner. While you may balk at shelling out more money on top of your ticket patience is a limited commodity, don't stress-eat, or start screaming at your in-laws. Buisness class is absurdely expensive, but economy-plus seats may be worth it for your individual case.

General rules: the further back you are, the louder it will be (if you're behind the engines), the smellier it will be (if you're close to the bathrooms), and the more surrounded by inexperienced travelers you will be. If you want to sit with someone book together, and check in together. Sit in your assigned seat unless you've verbally agreed with someone else to swap.

## Stay Calm

Know what you cannot control and try to not let it bother you. When talking to gate attendants, screaming or becoming visibly upset will just about never help your case. In most cases these people will start tuning you out. Instead of proclaiming "this is ridiculous" if something goes wrong. Ask the person helping instead "What can you (or we) do to help fix this problem?". If someone cuts you in line or offends you in some way, calmly point it out to them. Maybe they didn't even realize. Say "Excuse me, I was already standing behind [point to person in line]" as a statement of truth. If you get mad, upset, or try to come off as a line hero you may provke indignation in the person and cause a conflict. If you say nothing, you'll feel resentment. Stick to facts, things that are provably true, when you don't have that use "I" statements, never accuse.

Instead of trying to be super-prepared for everything that could go wrong, acknowledge uncertainty exists. Flights get delayed, luggage gets lost, planes get over-booked
